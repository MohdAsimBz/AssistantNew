# Enhanced Assistant API for Behtar Zindagi

This is an enhanced version of the Behtar Zindagi assistant API that addresses the following key issues:

## Fixed Issues

1. **Price Range Filtering**: Now properly handles queries like "milking machine under Rs 20000" by extracting price constraints and filtering products accordingly.

2. **Intent Recognition**: Detects when customers express negative intent (don't want products) and responds appropriately without suggesting products.

3. **Enhanced Matching Logic**: Improved relevance scoring and product matching to return more accurate results.

## Key Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Handles Hindi, Hinglish, and English queries
- **Price Range Extraction**: Supports various price formats (10k, â‚¹15000, under 20k, etc.)
- **Negative Intent Detection**: Recognizes when users don't want products
- **JSON Response Format**: Structured product responses as required
- **Database Integration**: Thread management with SQL Server
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Ready for messaging platform integration

## Usage

2. Update database connection string if needed
3. Run the application: `dotnet run`
4. Type queries to test the enhanced functionality
